A modular WhatsApp bot built using Node.js and Baileys — the perfect foundation for my YouTube tutorial series.  
This base lets you add new commands daily, helping you create a fully customized WhatsApp bot from scratch, even if you're new to coding.

## 💡 Key Features
- **Dynamic Plugin System**: Simply add .js files for new commands — no complex setup required.
- **Auto-Reload Functionality**: Changes take effect instantly without restarting the bot.
- **Permission Controls**: Built-in support for owner and admin roles to manage access.
- **Organized Command Categories**: Keeps your bot structured and easy to navigate.
- **Essential Tools**: Includes system utilities, media handling, and more.
- **Beginner-Friendly**: Clean, readable code designed for learning and experimentation.

Follow along with the tutorial series: Each episode introduces 1–2 new commands, building your skills step by step.
